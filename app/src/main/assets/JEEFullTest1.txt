In E2 elimination, some compounds follow Hoffmann's rule which means
Dichlorocarbene is generated by the action of potassium-1-butoxide on chloroform. This is an example of
A charge Q is to be divided on 2 objects. What should be the values of the charges on the objects so that the force between the objects can be maximum?
If a,b,x,y are positive natural numbers such that 1/x + 1/y = 1, then (a^x)/x + (b^y)/y is
the double bond goes to the most substituted position
the compound is resistant to elimination
no double bond is formed
the double bond goes mainly towards the least substituted carbon
