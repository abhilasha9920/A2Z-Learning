2,4,6-Trinitroiodobenzene has 3 C-N bomds labelled as a, b and c. The correct bond length of the three bonds is :
Lassaigne's extract of p-nitrochlorobenzene is acidified with dilute HNO3 and then treated with silver nitrate sol., the white precipitate formed is due to
A mixture of 2 organic compounds 'A' (b.pt. 80 C) and 'B' (b.pt. 110 C) can be separated by

a > b > c
a = b > c
a = b < c
