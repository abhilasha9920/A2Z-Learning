The expression for torque t = (a * L) + (b * I/w) where L represents angular momentum, I is the moment of inertia and w is angular velocity. The dimensions of a*b are
In an experiment, 4 quantities a,b,c and d are measured with % error 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% respectively. Quantity P is calculated as follows % error in P is P = (a^3 * b^2)/(c * d)
If force(F), velocity(V) and time(T) are taken as fundamental units, then the dimensions of mass are
In a tangent galvanometer, current i is proportional to tan d where d is angular deflection. The relative error in i will be least when d is equal to
