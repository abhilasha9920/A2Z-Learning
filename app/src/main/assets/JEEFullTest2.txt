When an aqueous sol. of D-glucose is treated with a base, it is converted into D-fructose and D-mannose, this conversion(isomerisation) involves
2 capacitors C1 and C2 are charged to 120 V and 200 V respectively. It is found that by connecting them together the potential on each one can be made zero. Then
