When certain metal surfeces are illuminated
by UV radiation (and in some cases by visible
light),the electrons are emitted from them.
This phenomenon is known as photoelectric
effect. By absorbing energy from the incident
electromagnetic radiation, the electrons in
the metal escape the attraction of positive
ions in the metal.
